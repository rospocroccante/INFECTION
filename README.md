# INFECTION
Infection is a simulation where healthy entities (green) and virus entities (red) interact dynamically. When a virus enters the proximity of a healthy cell, the cell begins to turn orange, indicating exposure. If exposure lasts longer than N seconds, the cell becomes infected (red) and starts spreading the virus to nearby healthy cells. |  Made in C# during the first academic year at AIV - ( Accedemia Italiana Videogiochi)
